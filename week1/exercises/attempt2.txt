Question 1(seed = 466539)Give the id[] array that results from the following sequence of 6 unionoperations on a set of 10 items using the quick-find algorithm.    9-1 0-3 2-9 9-4 4-7 0-4 Recall: our quick-find convention for the union operation p-q is to change id[p](and perhaps some other entries) but not id[q].Answer for Question 1You entered:Your Answer		Score	Explanation7777756787	Incorrect	0.00	Total		0.00 / 1.00	Question ExplanationThe correct answer is:7 7 7 7 7 5 6 7 8 7Here is the id[] array after each union operation:      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 9-1:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 0-3:  3 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2-9:  3 1 1 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 9-4:  3 4 4 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 4-7:  3 7 7 3 7 5 6 7 8 7 0-4:  7 7 7 7 7 5 6 7 8 7 Question 2(seed = 182653)Give the id[] array that results from the following sequence of 9 unionoperations on a set of 10 items using the weighted quick-union algorithm from lecture.    4-5 6-9 0-8 2-3 1-5 9-3 0-1 4-2 4-7 Recall: when joining two trees of equal size, our weighted quick union convention is tomake the root of the second tree point to the root of the first tree. Also, our weightedquick union algorithm uses union by size (number of nodes), not union by height.Answer for Question 2You entered:Your Answer		Score	Explanation0062144406	Incorrect	0.00	Total		0.00 / 1.00	Question ExplanationThe correct answer is:4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 0 6Here is the id[] array after each union operation:      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 4-5:  0 1 2 3 4 4 6 7 8 9 6-9:  0 1 2 3 4 4 6 7 8 6 0-8:  0 1 2 3 4 4 6 7 0 6 2-3:  0 1 2 2 4 4 6 7 0 6 1-5:  0 4 2 2 4 4 6 7 0 6 9-3:  0 4 6 2 4 4 6 7 0 6 0-1:  4 4 6 2 4 4 6 7 0 6 4-2:  4 4 6 2 4 4 4 7 0 6 4-7:  4 4 6 2 4 4 4 4 0 6 Question 3(seed = 404198)Which of the following id[] array(s) could be the result of running the weighted quick unionalgorithm on a set of 10 items?
